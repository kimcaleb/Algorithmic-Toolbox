1. Receive input. 
2. Create a string variable called input. Use the replaceAll() and toLowerCase() methods of the String class to remove any characters that are not a letter and empty spaces. Transform the string to all lowercase. 
3. Create 2 LinkedList objects and store it in  LinkedList reference variables, call one stack and the other queue.
4. Create char[] array and use the toCharArray() method on the String input and store the result into the char[] array variable.
5. Use the addLast() method to add the characters into the queue;
6. Use the push() method to add the characters into the stack.
7. while (the stack size is greater than 0)
	if(the popped item from the stack equals the removedFirst item from queue)
		continue;
	else 
		return false;
8. Return true. (It is a palindrome)
