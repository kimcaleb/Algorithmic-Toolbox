1. Create a HashMap
2. Iterate through the linked list. 
3. For each element, read the employee's id. Use the HashMap to put that element's id as the key and employee instance as the value. 
3. Your new data structure HashMap now has the elmenets from the linkedlist but wtih duplicates removed because of the nature of the HashMap.put() method.
