Use the Euclidean Algorithm
Receive input a and b.
Note: In java, the division of two integer values will always round bottowm. 

1. Find the greater of the two values. 
2. Perform the modulo operation of the larger value by the samller one. Store the result in a variable, let's call it mod. 
3. Perform the modulo operation of the previous smaller number by the mod. Replace the new mod variable with new value. Figure out a way to keep track of the smaller variable value for each iteration.
4. Repeat until the value returned by the modulo operation is 0. 
5. The greatest common divisor is whatever is stored in the mod previously before it was evaluated to 0.
6. Return this value.
